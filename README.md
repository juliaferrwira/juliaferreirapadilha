## ˚₊‧ Hi! I'm Julia ;)

I'm 17 years old, and I'm driven by the desire to learn and the motivation to create new things. I love exploring new interests, diving into different projects, and discovering new things!

I graduated from high school with a technical degree in Systems Development, and I am currently studying Information Systems at PUCPR. Since then, I have been taking courses, working on independent projects, and delving into new technologies and frameworks ⊹ ₊  ⁺‧₊˚

Here on GitHub, you will find everything from course projects to ideas that came out of nowhere and turned into code!

At the moment, I'm working as a junior developer. Even being full stack, my main focus is backend.
